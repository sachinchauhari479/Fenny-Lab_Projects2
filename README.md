worked on analyzing the Electric Vehicle market in India using Market Segmentation Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms.
# Introduction
With the current depletion of fossil fuels and its price hike, there is a need for 
another energy resource to run the vehicle. The automobile sector is considering 
Electric Vehicle as a solution to the industry and environment in India. However, 
the current market penetration of EV is relatively low despite governments 
implementing EV policies. Through this report we will analyse the potential scope 
of Electric vehicle in India and the potential market segments and suitable 
locations that new emerging Electric Vehicles Start-ups should target in their early 
market stages.
# Objectives
The specific objectives of this report are: 
1. erns and behaviours related to 
electrical vehicles. 
2. Indian Electric vehicle market segmentation using segmentation analysis and 
clustering to develop a feasible strategy for an EV Start-up to enter the market, 
targeting the segments most likely to use Electric vehicles. 
3. To identify the states/locations which are feasible for a new EV Start-up to 
set up their operations in the early market.
# Data Pre-processing
In data preprocessing we use different machine learning libraries, 
which help to understand the dataset and analyze are follow: 

* pandas 
* NumPy 
* Seaborn 
* Matplotlib 

First of all, import all libraries, once all these libraries were imported, 
we started understanding the datasets.
